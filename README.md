`askbot-audit` module enables auditing of content
in the Askbot Q&A forum.

Audit Queue
===========

Questions, Answers and the Comments are placed
on the audit queue where moderators can "ok" the content
and thereby remove from the queue.

Admin Tags
==========

In addition moderators can label any post with special
"Admin tags".

The "Admin tags" are separate from the tags used to
tag the questions in the main UI.

Certain Admin Tags are hardcoded, but new ones can
be added and configured

Audit Queue filtering
=====================
Items on the Audit Queue can be filtered by the 
Admin Tags, time period, author of the posts,
language of the post.
